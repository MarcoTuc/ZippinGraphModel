Petri.jl --> https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Petri.jl 
    Petri.jl is a Petri net modeling framework for the Julia programming language. Petri makes it easy to build complex reaction networks using a simple DSL. Once a model is defined, Petri.jl has support to generate ODE solutions and stochastic simulations using DifferentialEquations.jl. Examples and basic usage can be found in the documentation.

Catlab.jl --> https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl
    Catlab.jl is a framework for applied and computational category theory, written in the Julia language. Catlab provides a programming library and interactive interface for applications of category theory to scientific and engineering fields. It emphasizes monoidal categories due to their wide applicability but can support any categorical structure that is formalizable as a generalized algebraic theory.

AlgebraicPetri.jl --> https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/AlgebraicPetri.jl
    AlgebraicPetri.jl is a Julia library for building Petri Net models compositionally. This library acts as a bridge between Catlab.jl and Petri.jl. This package defines the category of Open Petri Nets as described in [Baez 2018].
