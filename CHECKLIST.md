# Slidings
Slidings happen to be kinetic traps because they are: 
1.  Very fast to go to the next configuration
2.  If next configuration is very unstable they are even faster at going back to the conf before 
3.  But also the trapping configuration will always want to go back to the other configuration
    since going back to the simplex is even less kinetically likely. I need to avoid these kinetic traps.
